### Result :heavy_check_mark:
I made a Etch-a-Sketch replica on a web page by using JavaScript, CSS and HTML. When the web page is loaded, by default, the div.container contains 16x16 divs. The user can increase the number of divs by moving the Range Slider which makes the drawing in the container to look more pixelated. The user can draw by hover the mouse over the div.container. Also, he is being given 4 buttons: Black - which makes the color of the 'pen' black, Rainbow - which attributes the 'pen' multiple random colors, Eraser - which makes the color of the 'pen' white which makes it look like it erases the color already on the board, and Reset - which resets the board.
